Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training. Also, it directly addresses OOD tracking generalization by including a fast backward-free dynamic test-time adaptation method that continuously adapts the model according to the dynamic visual changes of the target. Our extensive experiments suggest that SiamABC shows remarkable performance gains in OOD sets while maintaining accurate performance on the ID benchmarks. SiamABC outperforms MixFormerV2-S by 7.6\% on the OOD AVisT benchmark while being 3x faster (100 FPS) on a CPU. We also contribute by making the codebase publicly available at \url{https://wvuvl.github.io/SiamABC/}.

% I would first and foremost like to thank my thesis advisor, Dr. Gianfranco Doretto, for his support throughout my time as a master's student in his lab. In only two years' time, I gained an immense amount of knowledge on machine learning, computer vision, and most vitally, how to pursue meaningful questions and conduct deep, thoughtful, and valuable research under his guidance. In this manner, I have learned far more under his leadership than I could hope to within the same amount of time through any curriculum.

% Secondly, I am thankful for the direction, motivation, encouragement, and, equal in importance to these, the laughs provided by the other members of my lab: Shivang Patel, Zaigham Randhawa, Ranya Almohsen, Marcela Mera, Quinn Jones, and Sinan Sabri. Most importantly, I am deeply appreciative of my ceaselessly determined, bright-eyed second-in-command, Ram Zaveri. By observing, over the course of two years, the immeasurable progression of a student with only a few years' less experience, yet with seemingly twice the dedication toward shamelessly pursuing his goals, I have now become quite eager to see where these enviable characteristics will take him into the future.

% I would like to specially thank three important sources of inspiration. First, David Sokolov, for his existence as a paradox in nearly every positive manner -- to name just one, his ability to jump toward the most commendable ambitions, all the while remaining unwaveringly grounded. Second, Olexiy Fedorets, for being a reminder of the importance of exploration in finding an optimal policy, and in this way to always keep $\epsilon > 0$, to ``do what you can't,'' and to occasionally explicitly seek out the chaos. Third, Rachel Shim, for revealing that moments of great hardship can lead to a lifetime of inspiration, and the importance of leaning into your strengths even if from an outsider's view it just looks like you've always got your back on the ground.

% Finally, I am immensely grateful for the people I am fortunate enough to call family -- Mom, Steve, and Allie. It is pure, dumb luck to have three amazing people who have been willing to give me the space to grow when needed, who each pick me up in uniquely wonderful ways, and who have thankfully not disowned me after I've managed to do nearly everything they've kindly asked me not to do.
