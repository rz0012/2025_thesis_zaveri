\chapter{Potential Negative Societal Impact}
\label{Chapter7}
Our goal is mainly to advance the tracking performance of efficient visual tracking in-the-wild. On the other hand, if misused or used with ill-intent, this technology could potentially raise privacy concerns, especially if used for surveillance purposes, or other illegal activities like for stalking, bullying, etc. However, these are general issues that may arise even with other trackers that have been developed in the past. Our hope is to advance technology, and with regulations on its applications, we believe it should be possible to prevent its misuse.
