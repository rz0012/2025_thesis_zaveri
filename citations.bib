              bodies, membranes and nuclei from microscopy images. Deep
              learning has enabled great progress on this problem, but 
              current methods are specialized for images that have large

              learning-based segmentation method called Cellpose, which can
              precisely segment cells from a wide range of image types and
              does not require model retraining or parameter adjustments.
              Cellpose was trained on a new dataset of highly varied images
              of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also
              demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose
              that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not
              require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to
              the training data, we developed software for manual labeling
              and for curation of the automated results. Periodically
              retraining the model on the community-contributed data will
              ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.",

              TissueNet, a dataset for training segmentation models that

              magnitude more than all previously published segmentation

  abstract      = "Unsupervised contrastive learning has achieved outstanding
                   success, while the mechanism of contrastive loss has been
                   less studied. In this paper, we concentrate on the
                   understanding of the behaviours of unsupervised contrastive
                   loss. We will show that the contrastive loss is a
                   hardness-aware loss function, and the temperature
                   tau controls the strength of penalties on
                   hard negative samples. The previous study has shown that
                   uniformity is a key property of contrastive learning. We
                   build relations between the uniformity and the temperature
                   tau. We will show that uniformity helps
                   the contrastive learning to learn separable features,
                   however excessive pursuit to the uniformity makes the
                   contrastive loss not tolerant to semantically similar
                   samples, which may break the underlying semantic structure
                   and be harmful to the formation of features useful for
                   downstream tasks. This is caused by the inherent defect of
                   the instance discrimination objective. Specifically,
                   instance discrimination objective tries to push all
                   different instances apart, ignoring the underlying relations
                   between samples. Pushing semantically consistent samples
                   apart has no positive effect for acquiring a prior
                   informative to general downstream tasks. A well-designed
                   contrastive loss should have some extents of tolerance to
                   the closeness of semantically similar samples. Therefore, we
                   find that the contrastive loss meets a uniformity-tolerance
                   dilemma, and a good choice of temperature can compromise
                   these two properties properly to both learn separable
                   features and tolerant to semantically similar samples,
                   improving the feature qualities and the downstream
                   performances.",

               requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order
               to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to
               learn useful representations, we systematically study the major
               components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of
               data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective
               predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear
               transformation between the representation and the contrastive
               loss substantially improves the quality of the learned
               representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from
               larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to
               supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to
               considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and

                   paradigms for self-supervised learning (SSL). In a
                   principled way, it considers two augmented ``views'' of the
                   same image as positive to be pulled closer, and all other
                   images negative to be pushed further apart. However, behind
                   the impressive success of CL-based techniques, their
                   formulation often relies on heavy-computation settings,
                   including large sample batches, extensive training epochs,
                   etc. We are thus motivated to tackle these issues and aim at
                   establishing a simple, efficient, and yet competitive
                   baseline of contrastive learning. Specifically, we identify,
                   from theoretical and empirical studies, a noticeable
                   negative-positive-coupling (NPC) effect in the widely used
                   cross-entropy (InfoNCE) loss, leading to unsuitable learning
                   efficiency with respect to the batch size. Indeed the
                   phenomenon tends to be neglected in that optimizing infoNCE
                   loss with a small-size batch is effective in solving easier
                   SSL tasks. By properly addressing the NPC effect, we reach a
                   decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) objective function,
                   significantly improving SSL efficiency. DCL can achieve
                   competitive performance, requiring neither large batches in
                   SimCLR, momentum encoding in MoCo, or large epochs. We
                   demonstrate the usefulness of DCL in various benchmarks,
                   while manifesting its robustness being much less sensitive
                   to suboptimal hyperparameters. Notably, our approach
                   achieves $66.9\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy using batch size
                   256 within 200 epochs pre-training, outperforming its
                   baseline SimCLR by $5.1\%$. With further optimized
                   hyperparameters, DCL can improve the accuracy to $68.2\%$.
                   We believe DCL provides a valuable baseline for future

                   suggest that performing category alignment can alleviate
                   domain shift reasonably. However, they are mainly based on
                   image-to-image adversarial training and little consideration
                   is given to semantic variations of an object among images,
                   failing to capture a comprehensive picture of different
                   categories. This motivates us to explore a holistic
                   representative, the semantic distribution from each category
                   in source domain, to mitigate the problem above. In this
                   paper, we present semantic distribution-aware contrastive
                   adaptation algorithm that enables pixel-wise representation
                   alignment under the guidance of semantic distributions.
                   Specifically, we first design a pixel-wise contrastive loss
                   by considering the correspondences between semantic
                   distributions and pixel-wise representations from both
                   domains. Essentially, clusters of pixel representations from
                   the same category should cluster together and those from
                   different categories should spread out. Next, an upper bound
                   on this formulation is derived by involving the learning of
                   an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it
                   efficient. Finally, we verify that SDCA can further improve
                   segmentation accuracy when integrated with the
                   self-supervised learning. We evaluate SDCA on multiple
                   benchmarks, achieving considerable improvements over
                   existing algorithms.The code is publicly available at

              overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning
              approaches which require thousands of labeled examples to train
              an effective model. Considered as a hallmark of human
              intelligence, the community has recently witnessed several
              contributions on this topic, in particular through meta-learning,
              where a model learns how to learn an effective model for few-shot
              learning. The main idea is to acquire prior knowledge from a set
              of training tasks, which is then used to perform (few-shot) test
              tasks. Most existing work assumes that both training and test
              tasks are drawn from the same distribution, and a large amount of
              labeled data is available in the training tasks. This is a very
              strong assumption which restricts the usage of meta-learning
              strategies in the real world where ample training tasks following
              the same distribution as test tasks may not be available. In this
              paper, we propose a novel meta-learning paradigm wherein a
              few-shot learning model is learnt, which simultaneously overcomes
              domain shift between the train and test tasks via adversarial

                   Unlike many earlier methods that rely on adversarial
                   learning for feature alignment, we leverage contrastive
                   learning to bridge the domain gap by aligning the features
                   of structurally similar label patches across domains. As a
                   result, the networks are easier to train and deliver better
                   performance. Our approach consistently outperforms
                   state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised methods on
                   two challenging domain adaptive segmentation tasks,
                   particularly with a small number of target domain
                   annotations. It can also be naturally extended to
                   weakly-supervised domain adaptation, where only a minor drop
                   in accuracy can save up to 75\% of annotation cost.",

                     construct image representations that are semantically
                     meaningful via pretext tasks that do not require semantic
                     annotations. Many pretext tasks lead to representations
                     that are covariant with image transformations. We argue
                     that, instead, semantic representations ought to be
                     invariant under such transformations. Specifically, we
                     develop Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL,
                     pronounced as ``pearl'') that learns invariant
                     representations based on pretext tasks. We use PIRL with a
                     commonly used pretext task that involves solving jigsaw
                     puzzles. We find that PIRL substantially improves the

               applications, unsupervised learning has not seen such widespread
               adoption, and remains an important and challenging endeavor for
               artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose a universal
               unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations
               from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive
               Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such
               representations by predicting the future in latent space by
               using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic
               contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture
               information that is maximally useful to predict future samples.
               It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling.
               While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations
               for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is
               able to learn useful representations achieving strong

              image data acquired using optical microscopy. That is why image
              processing algorithms applied to these data typically offer
              imprecise and unreliable results. As the ground truth for given
              image data is not available in most experiments, the outputs of
              different image analysis methods can be neither verified nor
              compared to each other. Some papers solve this problem partially
              with estimates of ground truth by experts in the field
              (biologists or physicians). However, in many cases, such a ground
              truth estimate is very subjective and strongly varies between
              different experts. To overcome these difficulties, we have
              created a toolbox that can generate 3D digital phantoms of

               be trained end-to-end on only a few annotated ground truth
               segmentations. We achieve this by extending Noise2Void, a
               self-supervised denoising scheme that can be trained on noisy
               images alone, to also predict dense 3-class segmentations. The
               reason for the success of our method is that segmentation can
               profit from denoising, especially when performed jointly within
               the same network. The network becomes a denoising expert by
               seeing all available raw data, while co-learning to segment,
               even if only a few segmentation labels are available. This
               hypothesis is additionally fueled by our observation that the
               best segmentation results on high quality (very low noise) raw
               data are obtained when moderate amounts of synthetic noise are
               added. This renders the denoising-task non-trivial and unleashes

               a viable way to circumvent the tremendous hunger for high
               quality training data and effectively enables learning of dense

              and 3D images of varying complexities. By using foreground
              normalization and additional training on synthetic images
              containing non-cellular artifacts, NuSeT improves nuclear
              detection and reduces false positives. NuSeT addresses common
              challenges in nuclear segmentation such as variability in nuclear
              signal and shape, limited training sample size, and sample
              preparation artifacts. Compared to other segmentation models,

              analysis usually suffer from the domain shift problem caused by
              different distributions between source/reference data and target
              data. As a promising solution, domain adaptation has attracted
              considerable attention in recent years. The aim of this paper is
              to survey the recent advances of domain adaptation methods in
              medical image analysis. We first present the motivation of
              introducing domain adaptation techniques to tackle domain
              heterogeneity issues for medical image analysis. Then we provide
              a review of recent domain adaptation models in various medical
              image analysis tasks. We categorize the existing methods into
              shallow and deep models, and each of them is further divided into
              supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. We also
              provide a brief summary of the benchmark medical image datasets
              that support current domain adaptation research. This survey will

              method, named Panoptic Domain Adaptive Mask R-CNN (PDAM), for
              unsupervised instance segmentation in microscopy images. Since
              there currently lack methods particularly for UDA instance
              segmentation, we first design a Domain Adaptive Mask R-CNN (DAM)
              as the baseline, with cross-domain feature alignment at the image
              and instance levels. In addition to the image- and instance-level
              domain discrepancy, there also exists domain bias at the semantic
              level in the contextual information. Next, we, therefore, design
              a semantic segmentation branch with a domain discriminator to
              bridge the domain gap at the contextual level. By integrating the
              semantic- and instance-level feature adaptation, our method
              aligns the cross-domain features at the panoptic level. Third, we
              propose a task re-weighting mechanism to assign trade-off weights
              for the detection and segmentation loss functions. The task
              re-weighting mechanism solves the domain bias issue by
              alleviating the task learning for some iterations when the
              features contain source-specific factors. Furthermore, we design
              a feature similarity maximization mechanism to facilitate
              instance-level feature adaptation from the perspective of
              representational learning. Different from the typical feature
              alignment methods, our feature similarity maximization mechanism
              separates the domain-invariant and domain-specific features by
              enlarging their feature distribution dependency. Experimental
              results on three UDA instance segmentation scenarios with five
              datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PDAM

              the condition that they are trained on a sufficiently large
              manually labeled training set that is representative of the
              images to segment. However, due to differences between scanners,
              scanning parameters, and patients such a training set may be
              difficult to obtain. We present a transfer-learning approach to
              segmentation by multi-feature voxelwise classification. The
              presented method can be trained using a heterogeneous set of
              training images that may be obtained with different scanners than
              the target image. In our approach each training image is given a
              weight based on the distribution of its voxels in the feature
              space. These image weights are chosen as to minimize the

              (MR) images provides useful information for prostate cancer
              diagnosis and treatment. However, automated prostate segmentation
              from 3D MR images faces several challenges. The lack of clear
              edge between the prostate and other anatomical structures makes
              it challenging to accurately extract the boundaries. The complex
              background texture and large variation in size, shape and
              intensity distribution of the prostate itself make segmentation
              even further complicated. Recently, as deep learning, especially
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs), emerging as the best
              performed methods for medical image segmentation, the difficulty
              in obtaining large number of annotated medical images for
              training CNNs has become much more pronounced than ever. Since
              large-scale dataset is one of the critical components for the

              However, the performance of a well-trained CNN on an independent
              dataset (e.g., different vendors, sequences) relies strongly on
              the distribution similarity, and may drop unexpectedly in case of
              distribution shift. To obtain a large amount of annotation from
              each new dataset for re-training the CNN is expensive and
              impractical. Adaptation algorithms to improve the CNN
              generalizability from source domain to target domain has
              significant practical value. In this work, we propose a highly

              segmentation of the optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) from
              fundus images is beneficial to glaucoma screening and diagnosis.
              Recently, convolutional neural networks demonstrate promising
              progress in the joint OD and OC segmentation. However, affected
              by the domain shift among different datasets, deep networks are
              severely hindered in generalizing across different scanners and
              institutions. In this paper, we present a novel patch-based
              output space adversarial learning framework ( p OSAL) to jointly
              and robustly segment the OD and OC from different fundus image
              datasets. We first devise a lightweight and efficient
              segmentation network as a backbone. Considering the specific
              morphology of OD and OC, a novel morphology-aware segmentation
              loss is proposed to guide the network to generate accurate and
              smooth segmentation. Our p OSAL framework then exploits
              unsupervised domain adaptation to address the domain shift
              challenge by encouraging the segmentation in the target domain to
              be similar to the source ones. Since the whole-segmentation-based
              adversarial loss is insufficient to drive the network to capture
              segmentation details, we further design the p OSAL in a
              patch-based fashion to enable fine-grained discrimination on
              local segmentation details. We extensively evaluate our p OSAL
              framework and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the
              segmentation performance on three public retinal fundus image
              datasets, i.e., Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE. Furthermore,
              our p OSAL framework achieved the first place in the OD and OC

              generalization capability of deep networks on test data sampled
              from different distribution remains as a major challenge. In this

              network (PnP-AdaNet) for adapting segmentation networks between
              different modalities of medical images, e.g., MRI and CT. We
              tackle the significant domain shift by aligning the feature
              spaces of source and target domains at multiple scales in an
              unsupervised manner. With the adversarial loss, we learn a domain
              adaptation module which flexibly replaces the early encoder
              layers of the source network, and the higher layers are shared
              between two domains. We validate our domain adaptation method on
              cardiac segmentation in unpaired MRI and CT, with four different
              anatomical structures. The average Dice achieved 63.9\%, which is

              13.2\%) if we directly test an MRI segmentation network on CT

               simple anatomical information, e.g., structure size or shape,

              lot of high-quality papers have been published. GAN effectively
              improves the accuracy of medical image segmentation because of
              its good generating ability and capability to capture data

              principle, and extended variant of GAN, and it reviews the latest
              development of GAN-based medical image segmentation methods.
              METHOD: To find the papers, we searched on Google Scholar and
              PubMed with the keywords like ``segmentation'', ``medical
              image'', and ``GAN (or generative adversarial network)''. Also,
              additional searches were performed on Semantic Scholar, Springer,
              arXiv, and the top conferences in computer science with the above
              keywords related to GAN. RESULTS: We reviewed more than 120
              GAN-based architectures for medical image segmentation that were
              published before September 2021. We categorized and summarized
              these papers according to the segmentation regions, imaging

               Regarding our first innovation, we use a domain adaptation
               framework that combines a novel multispecies biophysical tumor

               information that can be leveraged if both modalities were

               educed learning approach where MR information that is educed

               unsupervised cross-domain adaptation (CT to MRI), followed by
               (ii) semi-supervised tumor segmentation using Unet trained with

               novel target specific loss, called tumor-aware loss, for
               unsupervised cross-domain adaptation that helps to preserve
               tumors on synthesized MRIs produced from CT images. In
               comparison, state-of-the art adversarial networks trained
               without our tumor-aware loss produced MRIs with ill-preserved or
               missing tumors. All networks were trained using labeled CT
               images from 377 patients with non-small cell lung cancer
               obtained from the Cancer Imaging Archive and unlabeled T2w MRIs
               from a completely unrelated cohort of 6 patients with
               pre-treatment and 36 on-treatment scans. Next, we combined 6
               labeled pre-treatment MRI scans with the synthesized MRIs to
               boost tumor segmentation accuracy through semi-supervised

               obtaining accurate pixel-wise labeling in X-ray images relies
               heavily on skilled clinicians due to the large overlaps of
               anatomy and the complex texture patterns. On the other hand,
               organs in 3D CT scans preserve clearer structures as well as
               sharper boundaries and thus can be easily delineated. In this

               X-ray image parsing from labeled CT scans. Specifically, a Dense

               achieve simultaneous style transfer and parsing for unseen real
               X-ray images. TD-GAN consists of a modified cycle-GAN

              under an assumption that the training and test data are under the
              same feature distributions. However, medical images from
              difference devices or the same device with different parameter
              settings are often contaminated with different amount and types
              of noises, which violate the above assumption. Therefore, the
              models trained using data from one device or setting often fail
              to work for that from another. Moreover, it is very expensive and
              tedious to label data and re-train models for all different
              devices or settings. To overcome this noise adaptation issue, it
              is necessary to leverage on the models trained with data from one
              device or setting for new data. In this paper, we reformulate
              this noise adaptation task as an image-to-image translation task
              such that the noise patterns from the test data are modified to
              be similar to those from the training data while the contents of
              the data are unchanged. In this paper, we propose a novel Noise
              Adaptation Generative Adversarial Network (NAGAN), which contains
              a generator and two discriminators. The generator aims to map the
              data from source domain to target domain. Among the two
              discriminators, one discriminator enforces the generated images
              to have the same noise patterns as those from the target domain,
              and the second discriminator enforces the content to be preserved
              in the generated images. We apply the proposed NAGAN on both
              optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and ultrasound images.
              Results show that the method is able to translate the noise
              style. In addition, we also evaluate our proposed method with
              segmentation task in OCT and classification task in ultrasound.

               mapping as the state-of-art CycleGAN, our model recovers a
               many-to-many mapping between domains to capture the complex
               cross-domain relations. It preserves semantic feature-level
               information by finding a shared content space instead of a
               direct pixelwise style transfer. Domain adaptation is achieved
               in two steps. First, images from each domain are embedded into
               two spaces, a shared domain-invariant content space and a
               domain-specific style space. Next, the representation in the

               for diverse image generation and remained effective with DSC of

               labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive in practical
               applications. Meanwhile, one might want to fine-tune pretrained

               collect enough target training images for proper fine-tuning.
               Therefore, there is a need for methods that can transfer learned

               This approach is effective in cases such as sample surveys or
               design of experiments, where the observed covariate follows a
               different distribution than that in the whole population. Under
               misspecification of the parametric model, the optimal choice of
               the weight function is asymptotically shown to be the ratio of
               the density function of the covariate in the population to that
               in the observations. This is the pseudo-maximum likelihood
               estimation of sample surveys. The optimality is defined by the
               expected Kullback--Leibler loss, and the optimal weight is
               obtained by considering the importance sampling identity. Under
               correct specification of the model, however, the ordinary
               maximum likelihood estimate (i.e. the uniform weight) is shown
               to be optimal asymptotically. For moderate sample size, the
               situation is in between the two extreme cases, and the weight
               function is selected by minimizing a variant of the information
               criterion derived as an estimate of the expected loss. The
               method is also applied to a weighted version of the Bayesian
               predictive density. Numerical examples as well as Monte-Carlo

               dimensional input points onto a low dimensional manifold so that
               'similar`` points in input space are mapped to nearby points on
               the manifold. We present a method - called Dimensionality
               Reduction by Learning an Invariant Mapping (DrLIM) - for
               learning a globally coherent nonlinear function that maps the
               data evenly to the output manifold. The learning relies solely
               on neighborhood relationships and does not require any
               distancemeasure in the input space. The method can learn
               mappings that are invariant to certain transformations of the
               inputs, as is demonstrated with a number of experiments.
               Comparisons are made to other techniques, in particular LLE.},

  abstract  = {Deep metric learning has gained much popularity in recent years,
               following the success of deep learning. However, existing
               frameworks of deep metric learning based on contrastive loss and
               triplet loss often suffer from slow convergence, partially
               because they employ only one negative example while not
               interacting with the other negative classes in each update. In
               this paper, we propose to address this problem with a new metric
               learning objective called multi-class N-pair loss. The proposed
               objective function firstly generalizes triplet loss by allowing
               joint comparison among more than one negative examples - more
               specifically, N-1 negative examples - and secondly reduces the
               computational burden of evaluating deep embedding vectors via an
               efficient batch construction strategy using only N pairs of
               examples, instead of (N+1) x N. We demonstrate the superiority
               of our proposed loss to the triplet loss as well as other
               competing loss functions for a variety of tasks on several
               visual recognition benchmark, including fine-grained object
               recognition and verification, image clustering and retrieval,
               and face verification and identification.},

  month         = jul,
  abstract      = {While supervised learning has enabled great progress in many
                   applications, unsupervised learning has not seen such
                   widespread adoption, and remains an important and
                   challenging endeavor for artificial intelligence. In this
                   work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach
                   to extract useful representations from high-dimensional
                   data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key
                   insight of our model is to learn such representations by
                   predicting the future in latent space by using powerful
                   autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive
                   loss which induces the latent space to capture information
                   that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also
                   makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While
                   most prior work has focused on evaluating representations
                   for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach
                   is able to learn useful representations achieving strong
                   performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text
                   and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},
